UK Wants “ITAR-Free Status” For Its Munitions As It Looks To End Reliance On U.S; To Establish New Domestic Supply Lines For Critical Ammo

The United Kingdom (UK) has announced plans to ramp up its weapons production in order to reduce its dependency on imports from the United States and France. The decision follows growing concerns among British and European governments about American military support under President Donald Trump.
U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said the government is committed to strengthening the country’s industrial base to support the armed forces and boost exports.
A key part of this initiative is to establish new domestic supply lines for critical munitions, including 155mm artillery rounds, which are used extensively by the British Army.
BAE Systems, the UK’s largest defense contractor, is developing new facilities to manufacture RDX explosives—an essential component of 155mm shells.
The company plans to build three new sites in the UK to become self-sufficient in the production of explosives and propellants. RDX has historically been imported from suppliers in the US and France.
BAE says its new approach involves producing synthetic energetics and advanced propellants that do not rely on traditional raw materials, such as nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, which are facing global supply constraints.

Until recently, the company relied on the US and France for its supply of RDX explosives. It now aims to achieve “ITAR-free” status for its munitions, meaning they are exempt from the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).
ITAR is a set of regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State that controls the export, sale, and transfer of defense-related articles, services, and technical data listed on the United States Munitions List (USML). If a product contains ITAR-controlled components, its export or use is restricted, requiring U.S. government approval, which can complicate international sales or collaborations.
The U.K. Ministry of Defense supports the company’s strategy as part of a broader effort to prepare for future conflicts, reduce logistical vulnerabilities, and generate economic benefits through skilled jobs and increased exports.
The UK’s move comes amid political turbulence in the United States, where the new administration has imposed tariffs on long-time allies and restricted intelligence sharing with Ukraine.
These developments have made it clear to many European governments that the US may no longer be a dependable pillar of the continent’s defense. Earlier this year, Defense Secretary John Healey described the defense industry as essential to the country’s ability to succeed in future conflicts.
Skepticism Around US Reliability
The UK’s decision is part of a broader trend among European defense ministries to reassess their reliance on US-manufactured weapons.
One of the key concerns has been the F-35 fighter jet program, in which the UK is a major partner. The aircraft has come under scrutiny after suspicions that its software could potentially be controlled remotely by the US through a classified feature known as the “Kill Switch.”
This switch, believed to be a built-in mechanism to disable or restrict the jet’s capabilities, has raised concerns among allies who fear that Washington could limit access or control usage in the event of political disagreements.
While the US government has denied the existence of such a system, its potential presence has raised concerns among many US allies.
The F-35 program has also faced criticism for delays, cost overruns, and limited access to sensitive source codes for partner nations. These concerns have contributed to a broader mistrust of US military support, particularly given the unpredictability of American foreign policy under changing administrations.
Growing Push For Defense Autonomy Across Europe
The UK is not alone in its efforts to reduce reliance on US-made arms. Across Europe, countries are taking similar steps.
In Germany, the government is investing heavily in expanding its own munitions production capacity. Rheinmetall has announced plans to construct a new facility for artillery shell production, designed to meet both domestic and NATO requirements.
The move is partly driven by the need to maintain consistent supply lines in the face of uncertainties surrounding US policy.
France, a longtime advocate for European strategic autonomy, is also pushing to strengthen its national defense industry.
Additionally, French President Emmanuel Macron has urged European Union members to prioritize European-made military weapons over American substitutes. This call emphasizes the importance of reducing dependency on non-European defense systems and fostering a more self-reliant European defense industry
Poland, one of the largest military spenders in Eastern Europe, has announced plans to jointly produce South Korean K2 tanks locally while also expanding its partnerships with European defense manufacturers. The decision reflects Warsaw’s effort to reduce exclusive reliance on the US while diversifying its procurement channels.
Nordic countries have similarly reconsidered their long-term defense strategies. Finland and Sweden, both recent NATO entrants, are expanding local arms production.
Sweden’s Saab is working on enhancing the Gripen fighter platform, marketing it as a cost-effective and independent alternative to US fighter jets. Saab said it will offer all Gripen export customers the same high-end capabilities as enjoyed by Sweden, in contrast to the American idea of pitching a “dumbed-down” version of the F-47.
Spain has also made moves to increase its self-reliance in defense. Madrid is focusing on naval capabilities and has commissioned new vessels built by the local firm Navantia. The country continues to invest in the Eurofighter Typhoon program and has avoided large-scale purchases of US systems in recent years.
Overall, Europe is undergoing a major rearmament push, with the European Commission announcing a plan to mobilize up to around US$872 billion over four years to boost defense capabilities.
The initiative, dubbed “ReArm Europe,” aims to reduce reliance on the US, support joint weapons production, and attract private capital into the defense sector.
These moves indicate a coordinated shift in European defense planning, with countries aiming to secure critical capabilities internally or through trusted regional partners. The drive for autonomy is not only about reducing dependency on the US but also about avoiding political bottlenecks that may arise from export restrictions, technology transfer limitations, or sudden changes in US foreign policy.
Trump’s Influence & Shifting Defense Postures
Donald Trump’s return to the White House in 2025 has revived concerns in Europe about the future of transatlantic defense relations. His first term was marked by criticism of NATO, threats to withdraw American troops, and demands that European allies bear a greater share of the financial burden.
Now back in office, there is speculation that his approach could once again lean toward isolationism, potentially undermining key defense partnerships. However, as his second term is just beginning, the full scope of his defense policies remains uncertain.
Trump had previously questioned America’s commitment to NATO and demanded that European allies shoulder more of the financial burden. He also imposed tariffs and export controls on traditional partners, signaling a retreat from multilateral cooperation.
Earlier, the Trump administration halted all US military aid to Ukraine, stopping the delivery of ammunition, vehicles, and other military equipment as it attempted to pressure Kyiv into agreeing to a peace deal. The shocking move of suspending aid followed a diplomatic fiasco in the Oval Office, where Trump lambasted Zelenskyy, telling him he was “gambling with a third world war”.
