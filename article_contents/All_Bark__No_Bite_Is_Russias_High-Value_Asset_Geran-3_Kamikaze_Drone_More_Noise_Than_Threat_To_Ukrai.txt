All Bark & No Bite? Is Russia’s “High-Value Asset” Geran-3 Kamikaze Drone More Noise Than Threat To Ukraine?

On the night of April 22, Russian forces struck Odessa using Geran drones that emitted a noticeably louder and higher-pitched sound during their terminal dive compared to previously deployed Geran-2 variants.
The altered acoustic signature led several typically reliable social media outlets to speculate that jet-powered Geran-3 drones had been used in the attack.
However, no physical evidence—such as drone wreckage—has surfaced to substantiate the claim. For now, the speculation rests solely on the distinctive change in sound during the drones’ final approach.
Shahed-238/Geran-3 Jet-Powered Drones
In November 2023, Iran unveiled a jet-powered variant of the Shahed-236, designated the Shahed-238, during a public exhibition.
Painted black—likely for visual stealth—the drone was claimed to be capable of carrying an electro-optical or radar seeker, a notable upgrade from the Shahed-236, which relies solely on inertial and satellite navigation to strike fixed coordinates.
The first reported use of a jet-powered variant by Russian forces dates back to December 29, 2023, when Ukrainian sources claimed that Russia launched black “Geranium” kamikaze drones with jet engines during a large-scale infrastructure strike. These drones were reportedly coated with radar-absorbing material.
In February 2024, leaked corporate documents from the Iranian company IRGC Sahara Thunder, discovered on a public server, confirmed the existence of the Shahed-238, referred to internally as the M-237.
Shahed-238
The drone was reported to be capable of speeds exceeding 600 km/h, a significant leap from the Shahed-136’s 180 km/h. It also featured a Nasir satellite anti-jamming receiver and was purportedly capable of targeting enemy drones.
On February 18, 2025, Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR) officially reported that Russia had begun producing the Geran-3, equipped with an Iranian Tolou-10/13 turbojet engine. Ukrainian forces claimed to have intercepted several of these drones, one of which was tracked flying at over 515 km/h—nearly three times faster than the Geran-2.
Russia is believed to have begun localized production of the Shahed-238 under the name “Geran-3”, with an estimated range of up to 2,500 km.
Photos of drone wreckage circulating on social media closely match the design of the Shahed-238, which was previously showcased by Iran.
Notably, since that initial reported deployment in late 2023, there have been no confirmed sightings or uses of the Geran-3, suggesting it may have been a limited trial or test run.
Doubts Over Geran-3 Usage in Odessa 
As previously mentioned, claims that Geran-3 drones were used in the April 22 strike on Odessa were based solely on the altered sound profile during the terminal dive. Ironically, despite being louder and higher-pitched, the acoustic signature lacked the defining characteristics of a jet turbine.
A day later, similar sounds were reported during Geran drone attacks on Kharkov, further fueling speculation.
According to the Military Informant Telegram channel, the change in sound is more plausibly linked to evolving swarm tactics.
In these instances, multiple drones reportedly loiter at altitudes of 2,000–2,500 meters, just beyond the reach of mobile air defense units, before diving steeply onto their targets.
During the descent, drones can reach speeds of up to 90 m/s, producing a louder, sharper whine, distinct from the low-pitched “moped” buzz typically associated with Geran-2 drones.
While evidence of Russia’s use—or preparation to use—jet-powered Geran drones exists, it remains inconclusive. Wreckage reportedly linked to the Shahed-238 (Geran-3) around January 2024 lacks sufficient verification to be considered definitive proof.
It’s also worth considering whether Ukrainian intelligence is amplifying the perceived threat posed by Russian experimentation with the Shahed-238—possibly to galvanize additional Western military aid.
The more than year-long gap since the initial reported sighting of a jet-powered Geran raises important questions: Is Russia still setting up production lines, or has it deprioritized the platform altogether?
The latter seems plausible, especially given Russia’s continued investment in upgrading the Geran-2, transforming it into an increasingly versatile and cost-effective strike platform.
Geran-2 Upgrades
Russia has steadily upgraded the Geran-2 drone since the start of the Special Military Operation, enhancing its stealth, accuracy, and lethality through a series of technological improvements.
The use of carbon composites has reduced both the drone’s visual and radar signatures while lightening the airframe, allowing it to carry a larger, more destructive warhead, reportedly in the 60–70 kg range, up from the original 40–50 kg payload.

Navigation has also improved significantly. The original GPS-based system has been replaced by a military-grade GLONASS SATNAV module, enhancing accuracy and resistance to jamming. The upgraded Kometa-M module, featuring 12 to 16 antennas, provides robust protection against electronic warfare.
In October 2024, a video surfaced on social media, allegedly captured via the optical/thermal imaging seeker of a Geran-2 variant, suggesting the development of a precision-guided version.
Further evidence came from a photo posted by the Military Informant Telegram channel, showing a Geran-2 equipped with an electro-optical seeker, reportedly displayed at the Special Technology Center (STC) in St. Petersburg.
To support real-time targeting, Russia has reportedly developed communication relay variants of the Geran-2.
These drones, operating alone or as part of a swarm, can transmit imagery captured by seeker-equipped drones back to an operator via single or multi-hop relays. This setup would enable the operator to designate targets in real time for kamikaze Geran-2 units, enhancing their effectiveness during the final approach.
Conclusion
Based on the Shahed-238, estimated to cost around $1.4 million, the Geran-3 would be a high-value asset, making it an expensive option for routine use.
Its limited endurance would constrain its loitering capabilities, and its high cost, combined with lower operational flexibility, positions it more as a cruise missile analog than a traditional kamikaze drone.
However, its ability to launch from ground-based catapult systems offers a unique tactical advantage. Unlike cruise missiles, which are typically launched from large, detectable platforms—such as strategic bombers, ships, or submarines—the Geran-3’s launch points would be harder to locate, complicating enemy preemptive strike efforts.
Given these characteristics, it is plausible that the Geran-3 exists and may be deployed operationally in select scenarios. However, its high cost, limited numbers, and niche utility suggest it is unlikely to be fielded at a scale significant enough to shift the overall balance of the conflict.
